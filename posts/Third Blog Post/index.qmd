Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and i

## **Types of clustering algorithms**

There are different types of clustering algorithms that handle all kinds of unique data.

### **Density-based**

In density-based clustering, data is grouped by areas of high concentrations of data points surrounded by areas of low concentrations of data points. Basically the algorithm finds the places that are dense with data points and calls those clusters.

The great thing about this is that the clusters can be any shape. You aren't constrained to expected conditions.

The clustering algorithms under this type don't try to assign outliers to clusters, so they get ignored.

### **Distribution-based**

With a distribution-based clustering approach, all of the data points are considered parts of a cluster based on the probability that they belong to a given cluster.

It works like this: there is a center-point, and as the distance of a data point from the center increases, the probability of it being a part of that cluster decreases.

If you aren't sure of how the distribution in your data might be, you should consider a different type of algorithm.

### **Centroid-based**

Centroid-based clustering is the one you probably hear about the most. It's a little sensitive to the initial parameters you give it, but it's fast and efficient.

These types of algorithms separate data points based on multiple centroids in the data. Each data point is assigned to a cluster based on its squared distance from the centroid. This is the most commonly used type of clustering.

### **Hierarchical-based**

Hierarchical-based clustering is typically used on hierarchical data, like you would get from a company database or taxonomies. It builds a tree of clusters so everything is organized from the top-down.

This is more restrictive than the other clustering types, but it's perfect for specific kinds of data sets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clustering is especially useful for exploring data you know nothing about. It might take some time to figure out which type of clustering algorithm works the best, but when you do, you'll get invaluable insight on your data. You might find connections you never would have thought of.

Some real world applications of clustering include fraud detection in insurance, categorizing books in a library, and customer segmentation in marketing. It can also be used in larger problems, like earthquake analysis or city planning.

# Implementation

We will use the [make_classification() function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html) to create a test binary classification dataset.

The dataset will have 1,000 examples, with two input features and one cluster per class. The clusters are visually obvious in two dimensions so that we can plot the data with a scatter plot and color the points in the plot by the assigned cluster. This will help to see, at least on the test problem, how "well" the clusters were identified.

The clusters in this test problem are based on a multivariate Gaussian, and not all clustering algorithms will be effective at identifying these types of clusters. As such, the results in this tutorial should not be used as the basis for comparing the methods generally.

An example of creating and summarizing the synthetic clustering dataset is listed below.

```{python}
# synthetic classification dataset
from numpy import where
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from matplotlib import pyplot
# define dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, random_state=4)
# create scatter plot for samples from each class
for class_value in range(2):
	# get row indexes for samples with this class
	row_ix = where(y == class_value)
	# create scatter of these samples
	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1])
# show the plot
pyplot.show()
```

Running the example creates the synthetic clustering dataset, then creates a scatter plot of the input data with points colored by class label (idealized clusters).

We can clearly see two distinct groups of data in two dimensions and the hope would be that an automatic clustering algorithm can detect these groupings.

## K-means clustering algorithm

K-means clustering is the most commonly used clustering algorithm. It's a centroid-based algorithm and the simplest unsupervised learning algorithm.

This algorithm tries to minimize the variance of data points within a cluster. It's also how most people are introduced to unsupervised machine learning.

K-means is best used on smaller data sets because it iterates over *all* of the data points. That means it'll take more time to classify data points if there are a large amount of them in the data set.

Since this is how k-means clusters data points, it doesn't scale well.

```{python}
# k-means clustering
from numpy import unique
from numpy import where
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from matplotlib import pyplot
# define dataset
X, _ = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, random_state=4)
# define the model
model = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
# fit the model
model.fit(X)
# assign a cluster to each example
yhat = model.predict(X)
# retrieve unique clusters
clusters = unique(yhat)
# create scatter plot for samples from each cluster
for cluster in clusters:
	# get row indexes for samples with this cluster
	row_ix = where(yhat == cluster)
	# create scatter of these samples
	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1])
# show the plot
pyplot.show()
```

### Mini-Batch K-Means

Mini-Batch K-Means is a modified version of k-means that makes updates to the cluster centroids using mini-batches of samples rather than the entire dataset, which can make it faster for large datasets, and perhaps more robust to statistical noise.

```{python}
# mini-batch k-means clustering
from numpy import unique
from numpy import where
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans
from matplotlib import pyplot
# define dataset
X, _ = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, random_state=4)
# define the model
model = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=2)
# fit the model
model.fit(X)
# assign a cluster to each example
yhat = model.predict(X)
# retrieve unique clusters
clusters = unique(yhat)
# create scatter plot for samples from each cluster
for cluster in clusters:
	# get row indexes for samples with this cluster
	row_ix = where(yhat == cluster)
	# create scatter of these samples
	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1])
# show the plot
pyplot.show()
```

### **DBSCAN clustering algorithm**

DBSCAN stands for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise. It's a density-based clustering algorithm, unlike k-means.

This is a good algorithm for finding outliners in a data set. It finds arbitrarily shaped clusters based on the density of data points in different regions. It separates regions by areas of low-density so that it can detect outliers between the high-density clusters.

This algorithm is better than k-means when it comes to working with oddly shaped data.

DBSCAN uses two parameters to determine how clusters are defined: *minPts* (the minimum number of data points that need to be clustered together for an area to be considered high-density) and *eps* (the distance used to determine if a data point is in the same area as other data points).

Choosing the right initial parameters is critical for this algorithm to work.

```{python}
# dbscan clustering
from numpy import unique
from numpy import where
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from matplotlib import pyplot
# define dataset
X, _ = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, random_state=4)
# define the model
model = DBSCAN(eps=0.30, min_samples=9)
# fit model and predict clusters
yhat = model.fit_predict(X)
# retrieve unique clusters
clusters = unique(yhat)
# create scatter plot for samples from each cluster
for cluster in clusters:
	# get row indexes for samples with this cluster
	row_ix = where(yhat == cluster)
	# create scatter of these samples
	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1])
# show the plot
pyplot.show()
```

### **Agglomerative Hierarchy clustering algorithm**

This is the most common type of hierarchical clustering algorithm. It's used to group objects in clusters based on how similar they are to each other.

This is a form of bottom-up clustering, where each data point is assigned to its own cluster. Then those clusters get joined together.

At each iteration, similar clusters are merged until all of the data points are part of one big root cluster.

Agglomerative clustering is best at finding small clusters. The end result looks like a dendrogram so that you can easily visualize the clusters when the algorithm finishes.

```{python}
# agglomerative clustering
from numpy import unique
from numpy import where
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
from matplotlib import pyplot
# define dataset
X, _ = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, random_state=4)
# define the model
model = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=2)
# fit model and predict clusters
yhat = model.fit_predict(X)
# retrieve unique clusters
clusters = unique(yhat)
# create scatter plot for samples from each cluster
for cluster in clusters:
	# get row indexes for samples with this cluster
	row_ix = where(yhat == cluster)
	# create scatter of these samples
	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1])
# show the plot
pyplot.show()
```

### BIRCH

BIRCH Clustering (BIRCH is short for Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) involves constructing a tree structure from which cluster centroids are extracted.

```{python}
# birch clustering
from numpy import unique
from numpy import where
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.cluster import Birch
from matplotlib import pyplot
# define dataset
X, _ = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, random_state=4)
# define the model
model = Birch(threshold=0.01, n_clusters=2)
# fit the model
model.fit(X)
# assign a cluster to each example
yhat = model.predict(X)
# retrieve unique clusters
clusters = unique(yhat)
# create scatter plot for samples from each cluster
for cluster in clusters:
	# get row indexes for samples with this cluster
	row_ix = where(yhat == cluster)
	# create scatter of these samples
	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1])
# show the plot
pyplot.show()
```

### Affinity Propagation

Affinity Propagation involves finding a set of exemplars that best summarize the data.

```{python}
# affinity propagation clustering
from numpy import unique
from numpy import where
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation
from matplotlib import pyplot
# define dataset
X, _ = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, random_state=4)
# define the model
model = AffinityPropagation(damping=0.9)
# fit the model
model.fit(X)
# assign a cluster to each example
yhat = model.predict(X)
# retrieve unique clusters
clusters = unique(yhat)
# create scatter plot for samples from each cluster
for cluster in clusters:
	# get row indexes for samples with this cluster
	row_ix = where(yhat == cluster)
	# create scatter of these samples
	pyplot.scatter(X[row_ix, 0], X[row_ix, 1])
# show the plot
pyplot.show()
```

### Spectral Clustering

Spectral Clustering is a general class of clustering methods, drawn from [linear algebra](https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-algebra-machine-learning-7-day-mini-course/).

```{python}
# spectral clustering
from numpy import unique
