Hello, I'm Daniel---a dedicated educator with a deep enthusiasm for sharing the intricacies of data science. My professional journey revolves around not just teaching these skills but also championing inclusive pedagogical approaches. I thrive on continuous learning and take pride in implementing cutting-edge methods that cater to diverse learning styles. Beyond the classroom, I actively engage with communities that share my passion, creating a collaborative space for growth and exploration. Join me on this exciting journey of knowledge, innovation, and community building!

Outside of work, I'm an avid hiker, novice (but passionate) meal-maker, and I really love the color green. Poke around my website to learn more! <!-- ::: -->
